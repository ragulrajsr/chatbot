# FOBOH News Chatbot â€“ Submission by Ragul Raj

Hi FOBOH Team 

Thanks for the fun and challenging prompt! This is my submission for the AI-powered news aggregator and chatbot system.

The app fetches news articles from 9 News and Sky News, removes duplicates, categorizes them, highlights key stories, and allows users to ask questions about the top news through a simple chatbot interface, all running locally without the need for external APIs.

- Scrapes articles from **9 News** and **Sky News**
- Cleans and filters duplicate articles using **fuzzy matching** and **semantic similarity**

- Extracts **top highlights** using keyword importance and frequency
- Includes a **local chatbot** powered by a small transformer model and FAISS search
